# About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Tatiana, a results-driven professional passionate about front-end development. Building upon my academic background and professional experiences, I'm transitioning into front-end development, driven by a desire for continuous growth, a commitment to embracing new challenges, and a discovered passion for coding.

ðŸ’» I hold a Bachelor's degree in International Management and a Master's degree in Digital Marketing from Technological University Dublin, Ireland.

ðŸŒŸ I have hands-on experience in software testing and digital marketing (graphic design, UX/UI), which has equipped me with a strong analytical and problem-solving foundation. Now, I'm channeling these skills into front-end development. I am intensively studying front-end development techniques and tools through online courses and hands-on projects.

ðŸš€ I'm excited about the opportunities to grow, learn, and contribute meaningfully to front-end development projects.
