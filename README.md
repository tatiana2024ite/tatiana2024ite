- About me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Tatiana, a results-driven professional with a diverse background in Digital Marketing. Building upon my academic background, I'm currently on a path of transition into the field of Information Technology, specifically software testing. 

ðŸ’» I hold a Bachelor's degree in International Management and a Master's degree in Digital Marketing from Technological University Dublin, Ireland.


ðŸŒŸ My transition into IT is driven by a desire for continuous growth and a commitment to embracing new challenges. I believe that adapting to the rapidly evolving technological landscape is not only essential but also immensely rewarding.
Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.

ðŸš€ I'm excited about the opportunities to grow, learn, and contribute meaningfully to software testing projects. My current career goal â€” to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
